Task 0 : Worst-Case: O(1)

There are only two statements with no additional input therefore the worst-case notation of this code is O(1)

Task 1 : Worst-Case: O(n)

There are 2 nested for loops (4 loops in total). For each of the outter for loops, they have a O(n) time complexity
and each inner for loop has a O(1) time complexity.
O(n) = O(n) > O(1) = (O1), therefore the worse-case notation for this code is O(n).

Task 2 : Worst-Case: O(n)

There is only for loop and it is O(n), therefore the overall worst-case notation of this code is O(n)

Task 3 : Worst-Case: O(n logn)

There are 3 separate for loops that are each O(n), one sorted() function that is O(n logn), 
and two nested for loops with the outter one being O(n) and the inner for loop being O(1).

O(n logn) > O(n) = O(n) = O(n) = O(n) > O(1) , therefore the overall worst-case notation of this code is O(n)

Task 4 Worst-Case: O(n logn)

There are 3 separate for loops that are each O(n), and one sorted() function that is O(n logn).

O(n logn) > O(n) = O(n) = O(n), therefore the overall worst-case notation of this code is O(n logn).
