Task 0 : Worst-Case: O(1)

There are only two statements with no additional input therefore the worst-case notation of this code is O(1)

Task 1 : Worst-Case: O(n^2)

There are 4 for loops and each is O(n). The loops are nested in pairs which gives 2 O(n^2).
O(n^2) == O(n^2) therefore the worst-case notation of this code is O(n^2)

Task 2 : Worst-Case: O(n)

There is only for loop and it is O(n), therefore the overall worst-case notation of this code is O(n)

Task 3 : Worst-Case: O(n^2)

There are 3 separate for loops that are each O(n), one sorted() function that is O(n logn), 
and two nested for loops that are each O(n) giving O(n^2).

O(n^2) > O(n logn) > O(n) = O(n) = O(n), therefore the overall worst-case notation of this code is O(n^2)

Task 4 Worst-Case: O(n logn)

There are 3 separate for loops that are each O(n), and one sorted() function that is O(n logn).

O(n logn) > O(n) = O(n) = O(n), therefore the overall worst-case notation of this code is O(n logn).
